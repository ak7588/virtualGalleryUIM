      <p id = "description1"> A prototype of a building envelope made from glass tanks filled with water and frogs. These frogs act like biosensors that can track how much oxygen is in the water at any given time. As the tanks lose oxygen, the frogs swim to the surface of the water to grab air and, in doing so, trigger an electronic sensor. These digital sensors pull in air from the outside of the facade and pass it through the water-filled tank where it becomes purified. Once the air bubbles reach the top of the tank, they're pushed up and out of an opening at the top, essentially releasing purified air into the space behind the facade. By passing the air pulled in from the outside over water, it creates a natural cooling system.  </p>

          At Optimal Living, the walls are alive. These walls are meant to provide natural sunlight and purify air. We bring nature indoor. Enjoy seeing those little creatures in your walls! :)

        Amphibious Envelope is an artwork that aims to challenge the traditional architectural techniques in an innovative and quirky way. As Benjamin says: “Why shouldn’t the facades in the city of the future be as responsive and as fluid and as “smart” as our phones and our laptops?” he asks. “Why shouldn’t they communicate information about the environment? Why shouldn’t they breathe and filter the air for us? Why shouldn’t they invite in the natural environment, including marine life? Why shouldn’t they help us navigate trade-offs between competing goals of shading and view, energy-harnessing and air-filtering? And why shouldn’t they make people stop and think and wonder?”
        <br><br>
        It's all about thinking, redefining and self-reflecting, which is a key part of Optimal Living.

          David Benjamin (‘05 M.Arch) is Founding Principal of The Living and Associate Professor at Columbia GSAPP. He also directs the GSAPP Incubator. Benjamin’s work combines research and practice, and it involves exploring new ideas through prototyping. Focusing on the intersection of biology, computation, and design, Benjamin has articulated three frameworks for harnessing living organisms for architecture: bio-processing, bio-sensing, and bio-manufacturing.
