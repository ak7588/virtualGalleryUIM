      <h2> From the artist: </h2>
      <p id= "subtitle1"> ​Our ultimate ​goal is not ​only for the ​new toilet ​system to save ​water and ​operational ​costs for ​wastewater ​treatment ​plants, but for ​us to ​establish an ​ecosystem that ​supports ​technology ​innovation and ​drives economic ​diversification ​where human ​waste literally ​has a financial ​value. <p>
      <p id = "description1"> Professor Jaewon Cho at UNIST is leading a project focused on a waterless toilet that recycles human waste into biofuel. The waterless ​toilet system, ​located on the ​first floor of ​the pavillion ​treats human ​excrement ​without using ​water. The ​system utilizes ​a natural ​biological ​process to ​break down ​human waste ​into a ​dehydrated ​odorless ​compost-like ​material. Then, ​at the ​microbial ​energy ​production ​system, this ​compost-like ​material is ​converted into ​biodiesel or ​heat energy. ​Once the ​grinding system ​inside the ​toilet converts ​feces into a ​dry, odorless ​material, it ​will be ​transferred to ​a digestion ​tank, ​containing ​thousands of ​different ​microbes. The ​microbes inside ​the tank will, ​then, ​biodegrade the ​powdered human ​manure to ​generate carbon ​dioxide and ​methane. Using ​high pressure ​and membrane, ​carbon dioxide ​is extracted to ​culture green ​algae for ​biofuel while ​methane is ​stored for ​later use as a ​heating fuel. ​ </p>

      <h2> From us: </h2>
      <p id= "subtitle2"> What's better than sustainable living? <p>
      <div id = description2>
        <p>
        Let’s be frank: we all use the toilet. With this twenty-first century invention, you will never have to pollute the environment with your waste again!
        <br><br>
        We believe the energy recycled from human waste can be used to generate electricity and support the whole residence. This artwork is self-sustainable and bring awareness to how much waste we produce every single day.

          JAEWEON CHO is professor of environmental engineering at the National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in Ulsan, South Korea. He directs the Convergence Research Center (CRC), named Science Walden, supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRFKorea). He is thinking of how to design many different things, including designing ecological engineering products (such as an eco-toilet), a community education program, and more importantly our thinking.
