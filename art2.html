      <p id = "description1"> SOMEONE imagines a human version of Amazon Alexa, a smart home intelligence for people in their own homes. For a two month period in 2019, four participants’ homes around the United States were installed with custom-designed smart devices, including cameras, microphones, lights, and other appliances. 205 Hudson Gallery in NYC housed a command center where visitors could peek into the four homes via laptops, watch over them, and remotely control their networked devices. Visitors would hear smart home occupants call out for “Someone”—prompting the visitors to step in as their home automation assistant and respond to their needs. This video installation presents documentation from the initial performance on four screens throughout the space. </p>

        This amazing artwork explores the extent to which we are willing to give our data and consent to corporations and governments. This artwork is about presence. SOMEONE's presence in particular. "We willingly give access to all our data and live camera feeds to huge corporations. But how does knowing a single human sits on the other side of the system shift our perception? Suddenly we become aware of what is at stake and what is possible."
